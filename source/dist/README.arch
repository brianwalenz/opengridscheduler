1) Description
--------------

   Architecture strings are used as unique identifiers for operating system
   brands and versions in various contexts in Grid Engine. Example uses are
   for making the compilation process generic, for installing across
   different platforms via the same procedures and for locating the
   appropriate binaries.  The architecture string is generated and returned
   by the script 'dist/util/arch' by printing it to STDOUT.

   'aimk', for instance, uses the architecture string to define the names of
   subdirectories where the binaries of a Grid Engine distribution later
   will be stored. Thus it is possible to easily create a distribution for a
   heterogenous cluster of Grid engine hosts in a shared directory.  'aimk'
   will map this lower case strings to upper case strings. The name of the
   upper case strings will be used to create subdirectories where the
   compilation will create object files and binaries for a single
   architecture target. This scheme makes it possible to use the same Grid
   Engine source code distribution for compilation on a variety of different
   operating systems.

   Often a binary set compiled on an older operating system will run without
   any problems on a newer OS version. The reverse is almost never true.
