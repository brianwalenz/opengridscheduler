.SH DESCRIPTION
.
By default, hwloc-ps lists only those currently-running processes that
are bound; it displays their their identifier, command-line and
binding.  The binding may be reported as objects or cpusets.
.
Process bindings are restricted to the currently available
topology. If some processes are bound to processors that are not available
to the current process, they are ignored.
.
The output is a plain list. If you wish to annotate the hierarchical
topology with processes so as to see how they are actual distributed
on the machine, you might want to use lstopo --ps instead (which also
only shows processes that are bound).
.
.PP
The
.I -a
switch can be used to show
.I all
processes, if desired.
