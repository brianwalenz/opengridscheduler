.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Be sure to see the figure in \fBTerms and Definitions\fP that shows a complete topology tree, including depths, child/sibling/cousin relationships, and an example of an asymmetric topology where one socket has fewer caches than its peers.

.SS " \fBhwloc_obj_t\fP hwloc_get_obj_by_depth (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fPtopology, unsigneddepth, unsignedidx)"
.PP
Returns the topology object at logical index \fCidx\fP from depth \fCdepth\fP. 
.SS "static inline \fBhwloc_obj_t\fP  hwloc_get_obj_by_type (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fPtopology, \fBhwloc_obj_type_t\fPtype, unsignedidx)\fC [static]\fP"
.PP
Returns the topology object at logical index \fCidx\fP with type \fCtype\fP. If no object for that type exists, \fCNULL\fP is returned. If there are several levels with objects of that type, \fCNULL\fP is returned and ther caller may fallback to \fBhwloc_get_obj_by_depth()\fP.
