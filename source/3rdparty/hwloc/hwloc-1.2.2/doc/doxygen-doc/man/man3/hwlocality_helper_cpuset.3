.SS "static inline \fBhwloc_const_cpuset_t\fP  hwloc_topology_get_allowed_cpuset (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fPtopology)\fC [static]\fP"
.PP
Get allowed CPU set. \fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the CPU set of allowed logical processors of the system. If the topology is the result of a combination of several systems, NULL is returned.
.RE
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
The returned cpuset is not newly allocated and should thus not be changed or freed, hwloc_cpuset_dup must be used to obtain a local copy.

.SS "static inline \fBhwloc_const_cpuset_t\fP  hwloc_topology_get_complete_cpuset (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fPtopology)\fC [static]\fP"

Get complete CPU set. \fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the complete CPU set of logical processors of the system. If the topology is the result of a combination of several systems, NULL is returned.

.SS "static inline \fBhwloc_const_cpuset_t\fP  hwloc_topology_get_online_cpuset (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fPtopology)\fC [static]\fP"

Get online CPU set. \fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the CPU set of online logical processors of the system. If the topology is the result of a combination of several systems, NULL is returned.

.SS "static inline \fBhwloc_const_cpuset_t\fP  hwloc_topology_get_topology_cpuset (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fPtopology)\fC [static]\fP"
.PP
Get topology CPU set. \fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the CPU set of logical processors of the system for which hwloc provides topology information. This is equivalent to the cpuset of the system object. If the topology is the result of a combination of several systems, NULL is returned.
