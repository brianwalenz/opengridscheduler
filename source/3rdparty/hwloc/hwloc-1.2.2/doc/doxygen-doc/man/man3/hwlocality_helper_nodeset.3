Get allowed node set. \fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the node set of allowed memory of the system. If the topology is the result of a combination of several systems, NULL is returned.
.RE
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
The returned nodeset is not newly allocated and should thus not be changed or freed, hwloc_nodeset_dup must be used to obtain a local copy.

Get complete node set. \fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the complete node set of memory of the system. If the topology is the result of a combination of several systems, NULL is returned.

.SS "static inline \fBhwloc_const_nodeset_t\fP  hwloc_topology_get_topology_nodeset (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fPtopology)\fC [static]\fP"
.PP
Get topology node set. \fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the node set of memory of the system for which hwloc provides topology information. This is equivalent to the nodeset of the system object. If the topology is the result of a combination of several systems, NULL is returned.

.RS 4
