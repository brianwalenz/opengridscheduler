.SS " int hwloc_obj_attr_snprintf (char *restrictstring, size_tsize, \fBhwloc_obj_t\fPobj, const char *restrictseparator, intverbose)"
.PP
Stringify the attributes of a given topology object into a human-readable form. Attribute values are separated by \fCseparator\fP.
.PP
Only the major attributes are printed in non-verbose mode.
.PP
If \fCsize\fP is 0, \fCstring\fP may safely be \fCNULL\fP.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the number of character that were actually written if not truncating, or that would have been written (not including the ending \\0). 
.RE

.SS " int hwloc_obj_cpuset_snprintf (char *restrictstr, size_tsize, size_tnobj, const \fBhwloc_obj_t\fP *restrictobjs)"
.PP
Stringify the cpuset containing a set of objects. If \fCsize\fP is 0, \fCstring\fP may safely be \fCNULL\fP.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the number of character that were actually written if not truncating, or that would have been written (not including the ending \\0). 
.RE
.PP

.SS "static inline char*  hwloc_obj_get_info_by_name (\fBhwloc_obj_t\fPobj, const char *name)\fC [static]\fP"
.PP
Search the given key name in object infos and return the corresponding value. \fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
\fCNULL\fP if no such key exists. 
.RE
.PP

.SS " int hwloc_obj_snprintf (char *restrictstring, size_tsize, \fBhwloc_topology_t\fPtopology, \fBhwloc_obj_t\fPobj, const char *restrictindexprefix, intverbose)"
.PP
Stringify a given topology object into a human-readable form. \fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
This function is deprecated in favor of \fBhwloc_obj_type_snprintf()\fP and \fBhwloc_obj_attr_snprintf()\fP since it is not very flexible and only prints physical/OS indexes.
.RE
.PP
Fill string \fCstring\fP up to \fCsize\fP characters with the description of topology object \fCobj\fP in topology \fCtopology\fP.
.PP
If \fCverbose\fP is set, a longer description is used. Otherwise a short description is used.
.PP
\fCindexprefix\fP is used to prefix the \fCos_index\fP attribute number of the object in the description. If \fCNULL\fP, the \fC#\fP character is used.
.PP
If \fCsize\fP is 0, \fCstring\fP may safely be \fCNULL\fP.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the number of character that were actually written if not truncating, or that would have been written (not including the ending \\0). 
.RE
.PP

.SS " \fBhwloc_obj_type_t\fP hwloc_obj_type_of_string (const char *string)"
.PP
Return an object type from the string. \fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
-1 if unrecognized. 
.RE
.PP

.SS " int hwloc_obj_type_snprintf (char *restrictstring, size_tsize, \fBhwloc_obj_t\fPobj, intverbose)"
.PP
Stringify the type of a given topology object into a human-readable form. It differs from \fBhwloc_obj_type_string()\fP because it prints type attributes such as cache depth.
.PP
If \fCsize\fP is 0, \fCstring\fP may safely be \fCNULL\fP.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the number of character that were actually written if not truncating, or that would have been written (not including the ending \\0). 
.RE
.PP

.SS " const char* hwloc_obj_type_string (\fBhwloc_obj_type_t\fPtype) const"
.PP
Return a stringified topology object type.
