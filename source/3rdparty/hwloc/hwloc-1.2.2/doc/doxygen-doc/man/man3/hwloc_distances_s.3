.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Distances between objects. 

One object may contain a distance structure describing distances between all its descendants at a given relative depth. If the containing object is the root object of the topology, then the distances are available for all objects in the machine.
.PP
The distance may be a memory latency, as defined by the ACPI SLIT specification. If so, the \fClatency\fP pointer will not be \fCNULL\fP and the pointed array will contain non-zero values.
.PP
In the future, some other types of distances may be considered. In these cases, \fClatency\fP will be \fCNULL\fP.

.PP 
.SS "float* \fBhwloc_distances_s::latency\fP"
.PP
Matrix of latencies between objects, stored as a one-dimension array. May be \fCNULL\fP if the distances considered here are not latencies. Values are normalized to get 1.0 as the minimal value in the matrix. Latency from i-th to j-th object is stored in slot i*nbobjs+j. 
.SS "float \fBhwloc_distances_s::latency_base\fP"
.PP
The multiplier that should be applied to latency matrix to retrieve the original OS-provided latencies. Usually 10 on Linux since ACPI SLIT uses 10 for local latency. 
.SS "float \fBhwloc_distances_s::latency_max\fP"
.PP
The maximal value in the latency matrix. 
.SS "unsigned \fBhwloc_distances_s::nbobjs\fP"
.PP
Number of objects considered in the matrix. It is the number of descendant objects at \fCrelative_depth\fP below the containing object. It corresponds to the result of hwloc_get_nbobjs_inside_cpuset_by_depth. 
.SS "unsigned \fBhwloc_distances_s::relative_depth\fP"
.PP
Relative depth of the considered objects below the object containing this distance information.
